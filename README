Zend_Cache_Backend_Mock - a Zend_Cache backend for unit testing

Has no external dependencies (files, memcache, APC) - only stores values in process memory

Cache contents do not persist between requests

Based on Zend_Cache_Backend_Blackhole from which it borrows much (non)functionality

Initially contains no expiration or tagging functionality
